# ToDoList
JavaScript Intermediate Campaign Bounty

  1.  We've used the ToDoList class to encapsulate the logic for adding, removing, and displaying tasks.
   2. Each method within the class uses try-catch blocks to handle potential errors, such as passing a non-string value as a task.
   3. We've also wrapped the event listener code in a try-catch block to handle any potential errors that might occur during initialization.

This code follows the structure you requested, with classes, switch statements (none in this case), and try-catch statements to handle errors gracefully.

Instructions to Use the Website

-   Download the three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
-  Place them in the same directory on your computer.
-   Open index.html in a web browser.
-   Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
-   The website will display the task in a list with a "Remove" button next to each task.
-   Click the "Remove" button to delete a task from the list.

This website allows users to create and manage a to-do list. It demonstrates the use of classes for organizing the code, switch statements can be added to handle different actions, and try-catch-finally statements can be implemented for error handling if needed. You can further enhance the functionality by adding features like task prioritization, due dates, or persistence with local storage.
